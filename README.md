# Android_Project

This is an android studio project, created for the purpose of "Advanced Topics of Human Computer Interaction (Mobile Programming)" class of the International Hellenic University,
in particular the Department of Information and Electronic Engineering.

This project includes two databases, one remote, one local. In particular I used ROOM API for 
the local database, and firestore for the remote one.

The interface includes one drawer menu, a lot of fragments and animations, for the sole purpose of better user 
experience.

The purpose of this app is to interact with databases concerning Sports.In particular you can add, delete, update tables regarding sports, athletes, teams 
and matches as well as using queries.
